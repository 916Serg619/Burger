A button will appear next to each burger, signifying that it is ready to be eaten, or devoured!

## Struggles
My biggest struggle with this assignment, other than my standard syntax issues, would be the design pattern itself.  I think because this the first time that I am attemtpting to follow a certain file/design structure, it's a little difficult for me to understand why it needs to be this way.  I think the amount of code was enough to get me confused, well.  But as always, youtube and tutorig came to the rescue.
